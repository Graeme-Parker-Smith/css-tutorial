                <p>Wow! This tour made me realize how much I love mountains.
                    After going on one of these tours, I can safely say that
                    they are my favorite geographic feature, and my favorite
                    word that starts with M.
                </p>
                <h6> -  Colt Steele</h6>
                <p>I ever understood why people cared so much about mountains.
                    But then I went on one of these tours. Now I can't understand
                    people who <em>don't</em> care about mountains!
                </p>
                <h6> -  Elie Schoppik</h6>
                <p>If you want to understand the universe, head to the mountains.
                    I mean, seriously. It's like, whoa. You know? It's like that.
